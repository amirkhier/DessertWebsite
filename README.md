## Website Review: http://raziyo.mtacloud.co.il

## Deployment in : Cpanel , mta cloud that belongs to Academic Tel-Aviv yafo College.


## Technology Details:
Welcome to the Dessert Recipe Workshop Website, a project developed as part of an academic endeavor at Tel-Aviv Yaffo College. This website is meticulously crafted using a combination of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with the Spoonacular API database through JavaScript, offering a wealth of culinary resources.

The backbone of our platform is securely managed through CPanel services, ensuring robust database connectivity and backend functionality. Explore an array of delightful dessert recipes and enhance your culinary journey through this immersive online experience.

## System Goals:
Our goal is to present unique and varied recipes that allow users to prepare the same dessert in a simple and quick way, utilizing ingredients they already have in the refrigerator.
In doing so, we give users greater flexibility and the ability to customize the desserts to their tastes and needs in a personalized way.

That's why we developed our platform "DESSFITS" "Making desserts from what is in the kitchen" where users can also upload their own recipes, search for recipes according to ingredients they have, mark the recipes they liked and with the help of this cooperation they receive coupons from us the more recipes they upload and the more active they are

We developed the platform as a website that can also be used on different devices, if there is success we will open an application in advanced stages.
